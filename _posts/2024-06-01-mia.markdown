Map It Anywhere (MIA) is a data engine that leverages Mapillary and OpenStreetMap to create a 1.2 million-pair dataset for Bird's Eye View (BEV) map prediction, enabling diverse and scalable training data. Models trained using MIA's dataset achieved 35% better zero-shot performance over existing baselines, demonstrating its potential to improve autonomous navigation.
