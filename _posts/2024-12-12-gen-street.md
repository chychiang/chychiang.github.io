This project generates realistic First-Person View (FPV) street-view images from segmentation masks and natural language inputs by fine-tuning ControlNet, leveraging Birds Eye View (BEV) maps and zero-shot learning with Llama 3.2 for structural and contextual accuracy. The approach improves realism, structural alignment, and feature accuracy, with applications in robotic simulations, urban planning, and interior design.
